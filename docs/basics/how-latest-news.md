## How it works

In general the latest news page just works in the background and there is nothing you need to update as its dynamic.

On the page you will see a few features:

- Posts (news articles)
- Categories
- Archive


By default the articles shown on the first page is set to 5 articles but this is possible to change if you wish in the settings.

The Categories and Archives in the sidebar are dynamic and no settings are needed.

:::warning
When adding categories try to keep to a set list of categories otherwise the list in the box will grow over time.

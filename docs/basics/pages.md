## Page Content

The editor is super simple to use you you see line of text **Type / to choose a block**

Think this as a search feature where you can add all types of content for example Headings, paragraphs etc..

<img src={require('@site/static/img/basic/page-3.jpg').default} />


## Page Properties

By Default the Template used for all pages is called **Default Template** which is a template with no sidebar, if you adding a page for About or Parents pages you should click and choose **Two Column**

Also by default comments globally on the site are turned off thus spam will be limted that is what the property **Discussion** means.

## Search Engine Optimization

This section is auto popuplated by in some instances you will need to overwrite the meta title and description if the content from content section is not detailed enough.

:::note
the purpose for the section is for the web so the pages are viewed via google and appear in search results better.

The fields Facbook and Twitter can be ignored but these are here so when the page link is shared on those platforms an image is also shared at the same time.

How to add image galleries to a page or post, the process for both is the same.

- Go to the Page or Post you like to add an Image Gallery.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/basic/example-page.jpg').default} />


## Choose Gallery Block
- From the sidebar in the search filed search for **Gallery** and click the icon.

<img src={require('@site/static/img/basic/gallery-1.jpg').default} />


## Insert Gallery

Next you click on the images to add to the gallery and click create a new gallery at the bottom. On the next screen you will be shown the selected images and give option to insert the gallery to the page/post.


<img src={require('@site/static/img/basic/gallery-2.jpg').default} />


## Configure the Gallery

The gallery will be inserted into the page now, but you have one more step before finishing.

You will see the toolbar with a **link** icon, click this.
<img src={require('@site/static/img/basic/gallery-3.jpg').default} />


From the dropdown makes sure to select **Link images to media files**

:::warning
If you dont choose this option then the gallery will not appear as expected in the page/post

<img src={require('@site/static/img/basic/gallery-4.jpg').default} />

Once you setup the link to media files the config is complete and you can publish the page.

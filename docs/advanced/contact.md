# Contact Form

There is one contact form on the website on the contact page, this form collects information and sends a response to the person who enters the data and also the school recieves a copy of the filled in form. The form submitted is sent to **office@blessingtonno1.ie**

<img src={require('@site/static/img/advanced/contact-form.jpg').default} />

You can edit the response by clicking on the form link and selecting the **Mail** tab.

## Mail Tab

There are two emails sent:

- Response to School
- Response to the user who filled it in.

In both instances you can edit the content as you like.


## New Forms

On the following screen you can go through the steps to create the fields, mail responses etc..
